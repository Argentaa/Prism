/**
 * What Mix knows about a song's rhythm and edges, all in ms from the song's start.
 *
 * @property bpm tempo, as heard (an octave can be off: 85 for a 170 BPM song); Mix compares tempos octave-free.
 * @property confidence how clearly the beat stood out (a z-score of the tempo's autocorrelation peak); ambient
 *   songs and spoken intros score low, and Mix then blends without lining beats up.
 * @property firstSoundMs where the music starts (leading silence ends).
 * @property lastSoundMs where the music ends (trailing silence or a fade-out's tail begins).
 * @property firstBeatMs the first beat at or after [firstSoundMs].
 * @property outroBeatMs a beat close to [lastSoundMs]; the song's last bars lie on `outroBeatMs + k × periodMs`.
 * @property fadeOutMs how long the song takes to die away before [lastSoundMs] (its fade-out, or a quiet last
 *   passage), up to 20 s; about 0 for a song that ends on a hit. -1 when measured before this was.
 * @property quietIntroMs how long after [firstSoundMs] the song stays quiet before it comes up to full level, up to
 *   20 s; about 0 for one that starts at full tilt. -1 when measured before this was.
